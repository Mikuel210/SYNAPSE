# SYNAPSE

**SYNAPSE is the new interpreter for [RUNTIME](https://github.com/Mikuel210/RUNTIME), a dynamic programming language
that removes the boundaries between data and code.**

## Project Overview

⛭ **RUNTIME is a complete reimagining of what a programming language could and should be.**

RUNTIME is a dynamic, interpreted language where code can think, adapt, and rewrite itself as it runs.
RUNTIME removes the boundaries between data and code, and empowers you with the tools you need to bring your raw, 
unfiltered creativity to life.

With RUNTIME, you can:

- ✔ Declare variables and functions from dynamic names
- ✔ Execute code and declare functions dynamically
- ✔ Interact DIRECTLY with the interpreter
- ✔ Modify the RUNNING PROGRAM in real time

Let's unleash the power computers are ACTUALLY capable of...

- ✔ Self debugging code
- ✔ Self evolving neural networks
- ✔ On demand AI written features
  
With RUNTIME, you can do that and much more.

⛭ **SYNAPSE is a complete rewrite of the RUNTIME interpreter**, built from the ground up in C# for greater power, stability 
and speed. SYNAPSE brings RUNTIME's philosophy to life by allowing for new possibilities, such as self-modifying 
and self-debugging software.
